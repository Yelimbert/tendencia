# Validation tests
1. If the user enters any letter or character, the program will say on the screen that only numbers and will stop its execution.
2. If the first three digits are equal to 000, 666 the program will tell the user not to accept the numbers 000 and 666 and will stop their execution.
3. If the first three digits are between 900 and 999 the program will tell the user not to that range of numbers is accepted and will stop its execution.
4. If the middle two digits are between 01 and 99, the program will display the value True for screen and continue its execution.
5. If the last four digits are not between 0001 and 9999 the program will tell the user that the number must be between that range and it will stop its execution.
6. If the user enters the social 435-12-9678 the program will print true indicating that the Social Security Number is valid.
7. If the user enters nine characters the program will automatically go to the first validation.
8. If the user enters 543-4p-5849, the first four digits will get into the integer array and in the next the program will stop and it'll display on screen "Social Security Number can only contain numbers!"
9. If the program detects a character that is not a number the execution of the program will stop and print "Social Security Number can only contain numbers!"
